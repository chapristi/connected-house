  <h1>embedded systems by chapristi</h1>
</div>

<p align="center">
  i wish make embedded systems to help people. For exemple to follow his/her consomation,  have surveillance camera, or even to get the distance for different projet and more easily and cheaper than what you can find on the market place.Its a sort of toolbox and you choose what you want, and you follow instructions... I started to make a client with  panel in javascript and a websocket server with python  to send the temperature from my sensor bme280 in my rapsberry to follow the temperature of my house in real time. 
  </p>


## Quick start

- To start you must have the **bme280 sensor**  pluged in at **raspbery**.<br>
- Install **all python libraries** after you have to run the command **python3 bme280.py** => server is running on the port **8080**<br>
- Run **npm install** after you have just to run command **node index.js** => server is runnig on the port **8000**<br>


## Demo
