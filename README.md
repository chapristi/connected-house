<p align="center">
  i wish make a completly connected house and i started to create a client with panel and a websocket server to send the temperature from my sensor bme280 in my rapsberry to follow the temperature of my house in real time.

## Quick start

- To start you must have the **bme280 sensor**  pluged in at **raspbery**.<br>
- Install **all python libraries** after you have to run the command **python3 bme280.py** => server is running on the port **8080**<br>
- Run **npm install** after you have just to run command **node index.js** => server is runnig on the port **8000**<br>


## Demo
